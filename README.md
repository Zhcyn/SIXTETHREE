# SIXTETHREE
Set (stylized as SET) is a real-time card game. The deck consists of 81 unique cards that vary in four features across three possibilities for each kind of feature: number of shapes (one, two, or three), shape (diamond , squiggle, oval), shading (solid, striped, or open), and color (red, green, or purple).[1] Each possible combination of features (eg a card with three striped green diamonds) appears as a card precisely once in the deck. It is still under development and testing, if you encounter problems, please contact me
